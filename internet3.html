            <p id="headp"><strong>Web 3.0</strong></p>
            <p id="conp">
                Web 3.0 has no particular definition but it is rather referred to as the new evolution of the web, its third generation, and includes specific innovations and practices. Or web 3.0 is where computers generate more information than humans.</p>

            <strong id="headp">Web 3.0 can rather be explained on its 5 main features:</strong>
            <ol id="webol">
            <li>Semantic Web</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Connectivity</li>
            <li>3D Graphics</li>
            <li>Ubiquity</li>
            </ol>
            <strong id="headp">Semantic Web</strong>
            <p id="conp">
            The main functionality of the semantic web is understanding through words, not by keywords or numbers. semantic can explain the meaning and emotion of the words and artificial intelligence can utilize the data to retrieve the information. The main idea is to create a spider web of knowledge across the internet which will help it to understand the meaning of words to generate, share, and connect content through search and analysis. Tim Berners Lee also stated that “Web of data that can be processed by words”.
            </p>
            
            <strong id="headp">Artificial Intelligence</strong>
            <p id="conp">
             By combining Artificial Intelligence with natural language processing, computers can understand information like humans and provide faster and more relevant results to the users. They become more intelligent to satisfy the needs of users.
            </p>
            
            <strong id="headp">Connectivity</strong>
            <p id="conp">
            With the help of semantic metadata information is more connected as a result users can experience another level of connectivity that leverages all the available information. As per now, the data is controlled by the application but by the connectivity feature, we can control the data from the whole web.
                Example - controlling google docs data from google calendar.
            </p>
            
            <strong id="headp">3D Graphics</strong>
            <p id="conp">
            The use of three dimensional images increases widely in web 3.0, the services like computer games, eCommerce, images in websites will be in 3D graphics. Most of the researchers also say that every person has a 3d virtual image which will be as popular as email address and phone number.
                Example - 3d virtual image in games.

            </p>
            
            <strong id="headp">Ubiquity</strong>
            <p id="conp">
            ubiquity means the presence of everywhere and anywhere at the same time. By using ubiquity content can be accessible by multiple applications, every device is connected to the web, the services can be used everywhere. Example - posts on social media.
